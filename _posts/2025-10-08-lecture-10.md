## 1. Research Projects and Reading Papers

### 1.1 Choosing a Project Direction

Before designing architectures (e.g., transformers), it is recommended to **first decide on an application domain**.

* Select an **area of interest** such as *medical image analysis*, *speech recognition*, or *sequence modeling*.
* Perform a **literature review** of approximately 10 recent papers within that field.
* Identify the **model architectures and methods** employed.
* Even without full comprehension, one can **replicate** or **slightly modify** those studies to form a meaningful project.

### 1.2 Critical and Optimistic Reading

Academic papers, even from leading institutions, invariably contain flaws.
The productive mindset combines:

* **Critical analysis**: Identifying gaps, assumptions, or methodological weaknesses.
* **Optimism and curiosity**: Recognizing that *“all papers are wrong, but some are useful.”*
  This balance encourages innovation while maintaining intellectual humility.

---

## 2. Motivation for Normalization

### 2.1 Optimization Landscape Intuition

Training via **gradient descent** can be visualized as movement over a *loss surface*.

* Thus, if topological graph is warped, gradient descent will bounce around from tangent to tangent.
* Proper normalization produces a **more isotropic (spherical)** loss contour, ensuring direct descent toward the minimum.

### 2.2 Deep Learning Context

* Input features can be normalized directly.
* However, **hidden layer activations** evolve during training, altering their distribution dynamically.
* This motivates *internal normalization* techniques such as **Batch Normalization**.

---

## 3. Batch Normalization (BatchNorm)

### 3.1 Conceptual Overview

Proposed by Ioffe and Szegedy (2015), Batch Normalization addresses instability in training deep networks.
It normalizes **intermediate activations** within each **mini-batch** to stabilize distributions.
Backpropogating larger parameters in gradient descent creates large partial derivatives, and multiplying many of them form a larger & larger number; batch norm helps to deal with "exploding gradients".

Essentially, these are additional layers on our models which improve stability and convergence rates.

Note: Assuming each minibatch is a node belonging to a given hidden layer, we are providing additional (normalization) information to each. 

Given activations $z_i$ for a layer across a mini-batch of size $n$:

$$
\mu_B = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i, \qquad 
\sigma_B^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(z_i - \mu_B)^2
$$

* $\mu_B$ and $\sigma_B^2$ are not learnable

Normalization:

$$
\hat{z}_i = \frac{z_i - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \varepsilon}}
$$

Affine transformation (learnable scaling and shifting):

$$
y_i = \gamma \hat{z}_i + \beta
$$

* $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learnable parameters allowing the network to **recover the optimal scale and bias**.
  * $\gamma$ controls the spread
  * $\beta$ controls the mean
* Optimal mean is 0 and optimal variance is 0, but the Batch norm layer can standardize with a zero mean and unit variane.
* This mechanism maintains flexibility while mitigating **exploding** or **vanishing gradients**.

---

### 3.2 Computation Graph Integration

BatchNorm fits naturally into the computation graph:

1. Linear transformation: $z = Wx + b$
2. Normalization: $\hat{z}$
3. Rescaling and shifting: $y = \gamma \hat{z} + \beta$
4. Nonlinear activation: $a = f(y)$

Since all operations are differentiable, **backpropagation** proceeds seamlessly.

---

### 3.3 Training vs. Inference

* **Training phase**: Uses *mini-batch statistics* ($\mu_B, \sigma_B^2$).
* **Inference phase**: Employs *moving averages* of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ accumulated during training.
  This ensures consistent behavior when batch sizes differ or when predictions are made one sample at a time.


---

### 3.4 BatchNorm in PyTorch
* Based on summary statistics of the mini-batch, we can normalize before scaling
* Implement model.train() and model.test() before training and testing, respectively

---

### 3.5 Empirical Benefits

1. **Accelerated convergence** through more stable gradients.
   * The model has the same optimization without batch norm, but with a smoother learning rate, we can train more quickly
3. **Mitigation** of internal distribution shifts.
4. **Enables higher learning rates** and deeper networks.
5. Often improves **generalization** due to mild regularization effects.

### 3.6 Theoretical Explanations (Multiple Perspectives)

| Year      | Explanation                                                   | Source / Insight             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 2015      | *Internal Covariate Shift* hypothesis                         | Original BN paper            |
| 2018–2019 | *Smoothing of optimization landscape*                         | MIT study (Santurkar et al.) |
| 2018      | *Implicit regularization effect*                              | Empirical observations       |
| 2019      | *Stabilized gradient dynamics allowing larger learning rates* | Theoretical reinterpretation |

Despite differing theoretical justifications, all confirm that BN improves training stability and speed.

### 3.7 Practical Considerations

* **Batch size sensitivity**: Too small → unstable statistics.
  * To improve, we can introduce larger mini-batch sizes 
* **Order of operations**: Commonly `Linear/Conv → BatchNorm → ReLU`; variations may be task-dependent.
* **PyTorch Implementation**: `torch.nn.BatchNorm1d/2d/3d`; ensure proper use of `model.train()` and `model.eval()`.
* **Alternative Normalization Methods**:

  * *Layer Normalization* (LN): Across features of a single sample; suitable for sequence models and transformers.
    * Finds the mean and standard deviation based on feature vectors (whereas mini-batches for batch norm)
    * Applied to transformers

## 4. Initialization of Network Weights

### 4.1 Importance of Initialization

Improper initialization can result in:

* **Symmetry** among neurons (if all weights equal): we cannot initialize all weights to zero.
* **Vanishing or exploding gradients**, especially in deep networks.
  Therefore, initialization affects both **convergence rate** and **final performance**.

This results in the inability for hidden layers to be distingushed from one another, and prevents us from finding the optimal minima.

---

### 4.2 Xavier (Glorot) Initialization

Designed for activation functions centered near zero (e.g., *tanh*).
Steps:
  1. Initialize weights from Normal distribution.
  2. Scale weights proportional to the number of inputs to the layer.
     
$$
W^{l} := W^{l} * \sqrt{\frac{1}{m^{l-1}}}
$$

* m is the number of input units to the next layer

Reasoning:

$$
Var(W) = \frac{1}{n_{in} + n_{out}}
$$

or equivalently:

$$
W^{L} \sim U\left[-\sqrt{\frac{6}{n_{in}+n_{out}}}, \sqrt{\frac{6}{n_{in}+n_{out}}}\right]
$$


Ensures that the variance of activations remains approximately constant across layers, avoiding saturation.

---

### 4.3 He (Kaiming) Initialization

Tailored for **ReLU** activations, which are non-symmetric around zero.

Same steps as in Xavier Initialization, but we add a factor of $\sqrt{2}$ when scaling weights 

$$
W^{l} := W^{l} * \sqrt{\frac{2}{m^{l-1}}}
$$

Reasoning: 

$$
Var(W) = \frac{2}{n_{in}}
$$

or

$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in}}\right)
$$

This scaling compensates for the half-rectification effect of ReLU and maintains activation variance consistency.

* **PyTorch default**: Linear and convolutional layers use He initialization by default.

---

### 4.4 Architectural Dependence

The optimal initialization scheme may depend on:

* Network **depth** and **width**.
* **Nonlinearity** used.
* Presence of **residual or skip connections**.
  Deep architectures often rely on *residual connections* to alleviate gradient vanishing, beyond what normalization or initialization alone can achieve.

---

## 5. Gradient Stability and Residual Structures

To combat vanishing/exploding gradients:

* Introduce **residual (skip) connections** or **scaled shortcuts** that enable direct gradient flow.
* Such designs have become integral to modern architectures (e.g., ResNets, Transformers).
